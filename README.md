# UI-Project

This week you will be building a minimum viable product (MVP) for a reminder app called "Water my Plants". Building a schedule around ensuring that all your plants are watered is actually pretty difficult. Water my Plants helps to solve those problems by providing and easy to use interface for creating a plant watering schedule that will remind users to water their plants on a regular basis.

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past three weeks and apply them in a project. In your project build week, you will demonstrate proficiency by creating a marketing landing page by using CSS Fundamentals, HTML, CSS Flexbox, JavaScript and GIT.


## Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps you to return to old code for any number of reasons.

You are required to showcase progress with at least 3 commits a day. This will let your project manager and team members know where you are and if you need help. This also allows the client to get progress reports from the company in a real world setting.


## Description

Find a template from a site like HTML5 Up and use that templates color scheme/design flow for your app. This is a task you will all do as a team. *Not all Marketing websites will look the same/follow the same theme, but at least one has to be the default for the React app.
